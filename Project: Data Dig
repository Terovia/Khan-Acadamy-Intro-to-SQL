Using Top movies dataset
The following SQL queries were used:


/* Aggregate data (Max, Min) */
SELECT Title, MAX(Worldwide) AS top_worldwide
FROM topmovies;

SELECT Title, MIN(Worldwide) AS worst_worldwide
FROM topmovies; 

SELECT Title, MIN(Overseas) AS worst_overseas
FROM topmovies;

/* Show top 10 results for domestic sales */
SELECT Title, Domestic
FROM topmovies
ORDER BY Domestic DESC
LIMIT 10;

/* Show Sony movies overseas */
SELECT title, Overseas
FROM topmovies
WHERE Studio = 'Sony';

/* List of Studios */
SELECT DISTINCT(Studio)
FROM topmovies;

/* Count how many movies each studio released */
SELECT Studio, COUNT(Title)
FROM topmovies
GROUP BY Studio
ORDER BY COUNT(Title) DESC;

/* Count how many movies each studio released before year 2000 */
SELECT Studio, COUNT(Title)
FROM topmovies
WHERE Year < '2000'
GROUP BY Studio
ORDER BY COUNT(Title) DESC;

/* Check profitability of studio */
SELECT Studio, ROUND(SUM(Domestic)) AS total_domestic,  ROUND(SUM(Worldwide)) AS total_worldwide, ROUND(SUM(Overseas)) AS total_overseas
FROM topmovies
GROUP BY Studio
ORDER BY total_domestic DESC;


/* Count how many movies each studio released in after year 2000 and before 2000 */
SELECT Title, Year,
    CASE
        WHEN Year < '2000' THEN 'Before 2000'
        ELSE 'After 2000'
    END AS Year_released
FROM topmovies
ORDER BY Year_released;
